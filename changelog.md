# Menu Loop Randomizer Changelog
## v1.9.2
- GitHub keeps marking releases as drafts for some reason.
## v1.9.1
- Against all odds, GitHub decided to mark 1.9.0 as a draft release.
  - Pretend I slapped a bunch of profanities in here. >:(
- Nothing in this binary has changed, this is purely a dummy update so everyone fetches the update properly this time.
## v1.9.0
- <cg>Added</c> "playlists" support (suggested by [TheTrueNyxa](https://discord.com/users/702243715812556863))!
  - Add songs to a playlist file, then activate `Load Playlist File Instead` to load your playlist file!
  - Favorite songs lists and song blacklists still apply.
  - Constant Shuffle Mode (formerly `Playlist Mode`) is also supported.
- <cg>Added</c> a new menu to see the names of all loaded songs.
  - <c-FFCC00>Gold</c> song names indicate a favorited song, and <cg>green</c> song names indicate a currently playing song.
  - *Italicized* song names indicate a NG/ML song that came from a different directory than expected (currently can happen with Custom Songs Folder by Sawblade).
  - Each song entry (besides the currently playing one) has a play button so you can change songs anytime.
  - <c-FF0000>No, I will not be adding a search bar.</c>
- <cg>Added</c> `Minimal` as an option for `Button Mode`.
  - Only one button appears in this Button Mode: the "Control Panel" button.
- <co>Fix</c> an issue where changing some settings didn't render a new song title card. Oops!
- <co>Fix</c> an issue where blacklisting songs didn't update the name of the song chosen as the new menu loop. Oops!
- <co>Attempted to improve</c> compatibility with song file path names that use non-UTF-8 encoding.
  - This is most noticeable on Windows. We just ***love*** and ***appreciate*** lack of UTF-8 support for nearly ***two decades***, don't we? :)
- <co>Retroactively rename</c> `Playlist Mode` to `Constant Shuffle Mode` across as many front-facing areas as possible to avoid confusion with more recent features (see first bullet point).
- <cr>Removed</c> elasticity from MLR menu opening animations. <c-FF0000>***This is a non-negotiable change.***</c>
- <c-aaaaaa>Moved</c> repository URL to Codeberg.
## v1.8.4
- Added `Advanced Logging` toggle.
- Added an easter egg.
## v1.8.3
- Allowed the name of the currently playing song inside the controls menu to update more often.
- Included Constant Shuffle Mode and Override Mode indicators in the controls menu.
- Refactor some additional code.
- Removed a controversial function hook.
## v1.8.2
- Added experimental support for iOS devices.
  - <c-ff0000>READ: ***EXPERIMENTAL***.</c> <c-ffff00>Getting this mod to compile for iOS is already enough of a pain to begin with.</c>
- Added experimental support for searching songs in nested folders (suggested by [RighteousRyan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnz-trf-dF7j8mDVOuoy4Ig)).
  - <c-ff0000>READ: ***EXPERIMENTAL***.</c> <c-ffff00>This setting may not work as expected for those with non-English folder paths/file names, or those using MLR on mobile devices.</c>
- Added experimental support for loading secondary folders (suggested by [RighteousRyan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnz-trf-dF7j8mDVOuoy4Ig)).
  - <c-ff0000>READ: ***EXPERIMENTAL***.</c> <c-ffff00>This setting may not work as expected for those with non-English folder paths/file names, or those using MLR on mobile devices.</c>
## v1.8.1
- Attempt to fix a bug where some filenames would be ignored.
  - The guy who reported the issue to me won't respond to my DMs to test if my bugfix worked. Shame on them, I guess.
  - Thankfully dankmeme01 was able to test those changes, so all's well! (I hope.)
- Created a separate menu for all buttons from this mod.
  - To revert to the original behavior, use the "Classic" `Button Mode` setting.
  - Existing mod settings for toggling the <cl>Blacklist Song</c>, <cl>Favorite Song</c>, <cl>Hold Song</c>, and <cl>Previous Song</c> buttons will only apply when using the "Classic" `Button Mode` setting.
## v1.8.0
- Added "Hold Song" button. Think of it like that "Hold" button from Tetris.
- Added "Previous Song" button (suggested by [DurexSensitive](https://github.com/DurexSensitive)). <cy>This only stores *one* song at a time. Don't expect this intentional limitation to go away.</c>
- Added "Favorite Song" button (suggested by [AlphaQuata](https://discord.com/users/766876726566846505)). <cy>Now your favorite songs are more likely to play!</c>
- Refactor a few things inside the code for readability and whatnot.
## v1.7.0
- New logo by [dasshu_](https://linktr.ee/jaydasshu)!
- Refactor how the song notification card is removed when switching scenes.
  - Constant Shuffle Mode may have been broken in the process if there is only one song available for the mod to choose from. But at that point, you might as well use a texture pack instead.
## v1.6.4
- Added option to replace unsupported characters with `?`s, enabled by default.
- Only display extended warnings for `Constant Shuffle Mode` when enabling it from mod settings.
- Preparing in advance for some naughty behavior from other mods.
- Changed logging level in anticipation of future changes to Geode.
- Removed Goro Akechi.
## v1.6.3
- Some cleanup from behind the scenes. Nothing noticeable for end users, though.
## v1.6.2
- Port to 2.2074.
- Remove the pink button config directory shortcut.
## v1.6.1
- Redo the button for blacklisting songs. Base icon shape provided by [FREAKINGDAN](https://github.com/freakingdan).
- Reduce confusion when copying song names/IDs while playing songs replaced by Jukebox/Auto Nong. {Reported by CyBlanc}
- Fix a bug where some songs downloaded from vanilla GD wouldn't be treated properly in Constant Shuffle Mode (potentially related to "No Songs Limit" being enabled). {Reported by ita_player}
- Make the setting description for Constant Shuffle Mode a scrollable setting description. {Reported by hiimjustin000}
- _Attempt_ to fix a bug where setting the music volume to 0 while on Constant Shuffle Mode would re-start a song while failing to end the original playback. {Reported by EmirNoob}
## v1.6.0
- Added "Copy Song ID" button (suggested by [Akashnil](https://discord.com/users/1068096599701590056)). <cy>Custom songs and NONGs will not return a song ID. They will fall back to its song name instead.</c> <cy>Button sprite adapted from [hiimjustin000](https://github.com/hiimjustin000) with permission.</c>
- Added "Blacklist Song" button (suggested by [AlphaQuata](https://discord.com/users/766876726566846505)). <cy>This button works regardless of your custom songs or Constant Shuffle Mode choices.</c> <cy>To manually un-blacklist a song, open `blacklist.txt` in the mod's config directory and edit it accordingly.</c>
- Fix a bug where Constant Shuffle Mode would ignore the in-game "Menu Music" toggle if that was disabled.
- Fix another bug where "Remember Last Menu Loop" would remember the original menu loop from GD's resources. 
## v1.5.0
- Added "Constant Shuffle Mode" (suggested by [TheKevineer](https://discord.com/users/633040761256017963)). <cy>This feature is incredibly unstable, especially outside of Windows. I have done everything I could to keep its behavior consistent between Windows, macOS, and Android, but any crashes/issues from this feature are either beyond my control or have been acknowledged during beta testing without an obvious/more immediate fix.</c>
- Added "Remember Last Menu Loop" (suggested by [HexCodesGMD](https://discord.com/users/1222327935315218506)).
- Renamed and reordered a few settings to reduce confusion.
- Added config directory shortcut button.
  - Incidentally, the pink config directory shortcut button from previous versions won't be added if QOLMod is loaded.
## v1.4.3
- Made sure the new "Regenerate Notification" sprite is actually part of the mod's resources.
- Also shrunk the mod file size down as there haven't been any new crashes from the changes introduced in v1.4.1.
## v1.4.2
- Redrew the "Regenerate Notification" sprite (courtesy of elnexreal).
## v1.4.1
- Add a new button to show the "Now Playing" notification again, per GitHub feedback. (The texture is incredibly scuffed. I will revise it later. The important thing is that it works as intended.)
- Attempted to fix a weird `stoi` crash. Not sure why it happens, but it did for the one person who reported it, and they didn't really provide further context beyond a crashlog file reading `C++ Exception: class std::out_of_range("stoi argument out of range")`. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
  - The mod now uses Geode's `geode::utils::numFromString<int>()` function.
- License the mod under LGPLv2.
## v1.4.0
- Added setting to choose font for "Now Playing" notifications.
- Added an extra child folder in the mod's config directory for enabling/disabling menuloops easily. The mod itself doesn't do anything to it beyond creating the child folder.
- Hopefully fix the mistake where macOS ARM support wasn't added the first time in v1.3.0.
- Fix rolling the same song twice in a row. (Unless if you have only one song loaded for the mod.)
- Fix that one godforsaken Android crash. (It was caused by ninxout being a bit silly and failing to check if certain directories existed on Android.)
  - Incidentally, this also fixes potential issues where songs from RobTop's Music Library *could* be added twice on certain platforms, skewing the probability distribution.
- Fix arrow steps in settings being wonky. (Geode has yet to support floating point increments in arrow steps.)
- Notifications now move off-screen when switching menus to minimize chances of the song title in the "Now Playing" notification from being incorrect.
- Add text formatting options for songs from Newgrounds or RobTop's Music Library.
  - Song Name
  - Song Name + Artist
  - Song Name + Song ID
  - Song Name, Artist, Song ID
- Added punctuation to the changelog.
## v1.3.0
- Added macOS support (thx [ninxout](https://github.com/ninXout), [raydeeux](https://github.com/RayDeeUx), and [hiimjustin000](https://github.com/hiimjustin000)).
- Added support for `.wav`, `.ogg`/`.oga`, and `.flac` files for custom songs.
- Included artist name for all "Now Playing" notifications.
- Set Z order of the "Now Playing" notification to 200 for easier readability against most MenuLayer mods (such as Overcharged Main Menu).
- Shuffling the song now generates a new "Now Playing" notification.
- Increase "Now Playing" notification maximum duration to 5 seconds.
- Add better slider control for adjusting notification duration.
- Added Node IDs to nodes added by this mod.
- Squash a few bugs, optimize a few things, minimize likelihood of potential crashes.
## v1.2.2
