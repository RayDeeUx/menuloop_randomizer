# Menu Loop Randomizer

Are you bored of hearing the same menu song <cr>over & over</cr>? Well... **No more of that!**

This mod allows you to randomize the menu song every time you open the game, picking from a random downloaded song from Newgrounds or your own songs.

## For macOS users

Due to incomplete bindings, <cr>this mod will not play songs downloaded from Newgrounds on macOS</cr>. <cy>Only custom songs are supported on macOS.</cy> Read below to learn more.

# How to add custom songs

If you want to add your own songs to the mod you should go to the settings tab, then click the folder button.

## Android

<co>*If you click the folder and you get sent to the geode folder itself, you should go to game/geode/config/elnexreal.menuloop_randomizer and put the songs there*</co>
