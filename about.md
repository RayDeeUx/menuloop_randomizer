# Menu Loop Randomizer

Are you bored of hearing the same menu song <cr>over & over</cr>? Well... **No more of that!**

This mod allows you to change the menu song every time you open the game, picking from the songs you downloaded through Newgrounds.

# Notes

- The song changes every time you restart the game, so you will not get another song every time you go back to the menu.
- In the future i'll add a setting to toggle between using NG songs or your own songs.

# Thanks to!
