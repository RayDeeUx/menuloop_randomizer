# Menu Loop Randomizer
Are you bored of hearing the same menu song <cr>over & over</cr>? Well... **No more of that!**

This mod allows you to randomize the menu song every time you open the game, picking from a random downloaded song from Newgrounds, RobTop's Music Library, or your own songs. `.mp3`, `.ogg`/`.oga`, `.wav`, and `.flac` files are supported.

# Adding custom songs
If you want to add your own songs to the mod you should go to the settings tab, then click the <cd>pink</c> folder button. Just like with grabbing songs you've downloaded from Newgrounds or RobTop's Music Library, `.mp3` and `.ogg` files are supported.

`.oga`, `.flac` and `.wav` files are also supported for the few audiophiles who want the highest of audio quality out there.

## Android
<co>*If you click the folder and you get sent to the geode folder itself, you should go to `game/geode/config/elnexreal.menuloop_randomizer` and put the songs there*</co>
