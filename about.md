# Menu Loop Randomizer
Are you bored of hearing the same menu song <cr>over & over</cr>? Well... **No more of that!**

This mod allows you to randomize the menu song every time you open the game, picking from a random downloaded song from <cl>Newgrounds + RobTop's Music Library (including NCS)</c> or <cl>your own songs</c>.\
`.mp3`, `.ogg`/`.oga`, `.wav`, and `.flac` files are supported.

*Note: To randomize menu loop __**starting points**__, see [Colon's Menu Loop Start Time mod](mod:colon.menu_loop_start_time). While the two mods **are** compatible with each other, you'd be better off using its "Chaos Mode" setting. Your call.*

# Adding custom songs
If you want to add your own songs to the mod you should go to the mod's settings menu, then "Click me to open the Config Directory!".\
Just like the songs you've downloaded from Newgrounds or RobTop's Music Library, `.mp3` and `.ogg` files are supported.\
`.oga`, `.flac` and `.wav` files are also supported, for the few audiophiles who want the highest of audio quality out there.

## Android
<co>*If you click the config directory shortcut and you get sent to the geode folder itself, you should go to `game/geode/config/elnexreal.menuloop_randomizer` and put the songs there.*</co>

## Windows
If you have non-English characters in the filenames for some of your songs, MLR will try its best to support it.
### But for `Remember Last Menu Loop`...
MLR may not remember a song with non-English characters in its file name between game restarts.

# Blacklisting songs
Ever felt like a song was an absolute dud? Click the <cl>blacklist button</c> (you'll know it when you see it) and you won't ever hear that song as a menu loop again.
