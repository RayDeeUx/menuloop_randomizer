# Menu Loop Randomizer

Are you bored of hearing the same menu song <cr>over & over</cr>? Well... **No more of that!**

This mod allows you to randomize the menu song every time you open the game, picking from a random downloaded song from Newgrounds or your own songs.

# How to add custom songs

If you want to add your own songs to the mod you should go to the settings tab, then click the folder button.
